***What is Project Euler?***
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."(Project Euler, 2022) [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net)
